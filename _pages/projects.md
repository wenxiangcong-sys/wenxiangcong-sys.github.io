<h3>Image processing, Reconstruction, and Generation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Image-related tasks—such as processing, reconstruction, and generation—are essential across diverse fields, including medical imaging, computer vision, entertainment, and scientific research. Each process targets specific aspects of image analysis and creation, often utilizing advanced algorithms and AI techniques to achieve optimal results. Together, these methods are instrumental in transforming raw data into meaningful insights and creative outputs, driving innovation and progress across industries.</p>

<h3>Photoacoustic imaging</h3>  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a groundbreaking biomedical imaging technique that seamlessly integrates optical and ultrasound imaging to achieve high-resolution visualization of biological tissues. By combining the rich optical contrast of light with the deep penetration and spatial resolution of ultrasound, PAI offers unique insights into tissue structure, function, and molecular composition. This transformative technology provides unparalleled capabilities for non-invasive, high-resolution imaging, making it a versatile tool with significant potential for clinical translation. PAI continues to drive innovation across diverse medical and scientific domains, redefining possibilities in advanced diagnostics and research.</p>

<h3>Cardiac tomographic Imaging</h3> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cardiac tomographic imaging represents a suite of advanced technologies designed to provide three-dimensional visualization of the heart’s structure and function. These techniques offer detailed insights into cardiac anatomy, blood flow, and tissue characteristics, playing a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. As a foundational tool in modern cardiology, cardiac tomographic imaging enables clinicians to make informed decisions with precision. With continuous technological advancements, these methods are poised to further improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance treatment planning, and ultimately elevate patient care.</p>
