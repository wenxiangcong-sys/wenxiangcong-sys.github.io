## Image processing, Reconstruction, and Generation:
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have proposed a novel score-matching formula to derive a new score function through deep learning on an image dataset. By integrating our new score function into the image reconstruction process, we have developed a new iterative reconstruction method within the MAP estimation framework to enhance image quality. We have evaluated the performance of our image reconstruction method on both public medical CT datasets and clinical raw datasets. Our reconstruction method consistently produced higher quality images in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics across diverse datasets. Notably, on Siemens and GE clinical CT raw datasets, our proposed approach achieved superior denoising and deblurring effects over the competing methods, illustrating remarkable generalizability and stability. Our proposed score matching formula holds potential in image denoising, deblurring, and generation.</p>

## Photoacoustic imaging  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising biomedical technique that combines rich optical contrast with high ultrasonic spatial resolution, overcoming the limited penetration depth of light in living tissues. PAI has demonstrated the ability to capture morphological, functional, and molecular information in human studies, providing intrinsic clinical indicators for applications ranging from early diagnosis to treatment monitoring.</p>

## Cardiac tomographic Imaging 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal is to leverage deep learning to eliminate artifacts from cardiac CT images without requiring costly hardware redesigns. This approach employs machine learning techniques to process projection sinogram data and perform both image reconstruction and analysis.</p>
