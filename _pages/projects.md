<h3>Image processing, Reconstruction, and Generation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have proposed a novel score-matching formula to derive a new score function through deep learning on an image dataset. By integrating our new score function into the image reconstruction process, we have developed a new iterative reconstruction method within the MAP estimation framework to enhance image quality. We have evaluated the performance of our image reconstruction method on both public medical CT datasets and clinical raw datasets. Our reconstruction method consistently produced higher quality images in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics across diverse datasets. Notably, on Siemens and GE clinical CT raw datasets, our proposed approach achieved superior denoising and deblurring effects over the competing methods, illustrating remarkable generalizability and stability. Our proposed score matching formula holds potential in image denoising, deblurring, and generation.</p>

<h3>Photoacoustic imaging</h3>  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising biomedical technique that combines rich optical contrast with high ultrasonic spatial resolution, overcoming the limited penetration depth of light in living tissues. PAI has demonstrated the ability to capture morphological, functional, and molecular information in human studies, providing intrinsic clinical indicators for applications ranging from early diagnosis to treatment monitoring.</p>

<h3>Cardiac tomographic Imaging</h3> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cardiac tomographic imaging represents a suite of advanced technologies designed to provide three-dimensional visualization of the heartâ€™s structure and function. These techniques offer detailed insights into cardiac anatomy, blood flow, and tissue characteristics, playing a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. As a foundational tool in modern cardiology, cardiac tomographic imaging enables clinicians to make informed decisions with precision. With continuous technological advancements, these methods are poised to further improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance treatment planning, and ultimately elevate patient care.</p>
