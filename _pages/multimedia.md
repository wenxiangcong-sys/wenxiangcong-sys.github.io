## AI for Medical Imaging
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing medical imaging by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, improving workflow efficiency, and enabling early detection of diseases. By leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, AI-powered tools analyze complex medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds, transforming the field of radiology and beyond.

<b>Disease Detection and Diagnosis</b>: Identifies abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and infections. Detects early-stage cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders.
<br>
<br>
<b>Image Segmentation</b>: Precisely delineates anatomical structures and lesions. Essential for planning surgeries, radiation therapy, and other treatments.
<br>
<br>
<b>Classification</b>: Differentiates between benign and malignant lesions. Identifies disease subtypes for personalized treatment planning.
<br>
<br>
<b>Quantitative Analysis</b>: Measures tumor volume, organ size, or vascular structures. Tracks disease progression and response to treatment. Combines data from different imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, PET) for comprehensive analysis. Integrates imaging with patient demographics and lab results for holistic insights.


## Future Directions in AI for Medical Imaging

<b>Self-Supervised and Transfer Learning</b>: Enhances AI capabilities with less labeled data.
<br>
<br>
<b>Federated Learning</b>: Protects patient privacy while enabling collaborative model training.
<br>
<br>
<b>Real-Time Imaging</b>: AI-assisted tools for intraoperative guidance and real-time diagnostics.Uses imaging biomarkers to predict treatment response and optimize therapies.
