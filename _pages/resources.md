## X-ray Grating-based Imaging Platform:

This platform is an x-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer (Figures 5 and 6), developed under the NIH grant R01 EB016977. A customized open x-ray source and a micro-focus x-ray source (L10101, Hamamatsu Photonics, Inc.) are used. The CMOS flat panel detector (XMARU1215-Master Plus, Rayence) has 2352x2944 pixels covering an area of 11.6x14.5cm2 at a maximum frame rate of 60fps with 4x4 binning. Two sets of three gratings G0, G1 and G2 (Micro-Works, Germany) are available for 28keV and 50keV x-ray imaging studies, respectively. The G2 grating is controlled by a high-precision linear stage (XA04A-R101, Kohzu Precision, Japan) with a minimum resolution 0.05Âµm. The distances among the source, detector, and gratings can be freely adjusted by translation stages (VP-25XA, Newport).
