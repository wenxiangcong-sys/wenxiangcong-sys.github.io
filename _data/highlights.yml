- title: "Virtual monoenergetic CT imaging via deep learning"
  image: Level2-Rep.png
  description: In this work, we present a physics-based deep learning approach that maps polyenergetic CT images to monoenergetic images at pre-specified energy levels. This method accurately approximates virtual monoenergetic (VM) images from DECT using only single-spectrum images, enabling multi-material decomposition with performance comparable to DECT.

- title: "Tomographic Image Reconstruction Using an Advanced Score Function (ADSF)"
  image: PFCM2.png
  description: Leveraging the Gaussian mixture model, we derive a novel score matching formula to establish an advanced score function (ADSF) through deep learning. Using the ADSF, a new iterative reconstruction method is developed to improve image reconstruction. The performance of the reconstruction method is evaluated on clinical raw CT datasets, showing excellent generalizability and stability.

- title: "Spherical grating based x‚Äêray Talbot interferometry"
  image: Nomen.png
  description: A spherical grating matches the wave front of a point x-ray source very well, allowing the perpendicular incidence of x-rays on the grating to achieve a higher visibility over a larger field of view than the planer grating counterpart. A theoretical analysis of the Talbot effect for spherical grating imaging is proposed to establish a basic foundation for x-ray spherical gratings interferometry. An efficient method of spherical grating imaging is also presented to extract attenuation, differential phase, and dark-field images in the x-ray spherical grating interferometer.

- title: "CT image reconstruction on a low dimensional manifold"
  image: SOGMAI.png
  description: We apply the low-dimensional manifold model (LDMM) to regularize X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction. This approach effectively recovers detailed structural information, significantly enhancing both spatial and contrast resolution. Clinical experiments show that the LDMM-based method achieves more accurate image reconstruction with high fidelity and improved contrast resolution.

- title: "Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Dual-domain Sparse-View CT Reconstruction"
  image: LAMA.png
  description: We propose a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) for dual-domain sparse-view CT image reconstruction. LAMA is induced by a variational model with learnable nonsmooth nonconvex regularizers, which are parameterized as composite functions of deep networks. We prove that LAMA is convergent for reliable image reconstruction.
