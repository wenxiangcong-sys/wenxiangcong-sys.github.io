- title: "Virtual monoenergetic CT imaging via deep learning"
  image: Level2-Rep.png
  description: Dual-energy CT (DECT) utilizes two energy spectra to produce virtual monoenergetic (VM) and material-specific images but at the expense of increased system complexity and higher radiation dose. In this work, we introduce a physics-based deep learning approach to map polyenergetic CT images to monoenergetic images at pre-specified energy levels. This method effectively approximates VM images from DECT using only single-spectrum images, achieving multi-material decomposition with performance comparable to DECT.

  description: Modern medical records include a vast amount of multimodal free text clinical data and imaging data. Fully mining such big data requires multitasking; otherwise, occult but important aspects may be overlooked. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) with application in lung cancer screening and related tasks.

  description: We propose a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) for dual-domain sparse-view CT image reconstruction. LAMA is induced by a variational model with learnable nonsmooth nonconvex regularizers, which are parameterized as composite functions of deep networks. We prove that LAMA is convergent for reliable image reconstruction.
